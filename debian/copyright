            Transitive Grace Period Public Licence ("TGPPL") v. 1.0

   This Transitive Grace Period Public Licence (the "License") applies to any
   original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the
   "Licensor") has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the
   copyright notice for the Original Work:

   Licensed under the Transitive Grace Period Public Licence version 1.0

    1. Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,
       royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration
       of the copyright, to do the following:
         a. to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part
            of a collective work;
         b. to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the
            Original Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative
            Works") based upon the Original Work;
         c. to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and
            Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of
            Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or
            communicate shall be licensed under this Transitive Grace Period
            Public Licence no later than 12 months after You distributed or
            communicated said copies;
         d. to perform the Original Work publicly; and
         e. to display the Original Work publicly.
    2. Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,
       royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent
       claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the
       Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the
       patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the
       Original Work and Derivative Works.
    3. Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the
       preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and
       all available documentation describing how to modify the Original
       Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source
       Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work
       that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this
       obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an
       information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and
       convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to
       distribute the Original Work.
    4. Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the
       names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their
       trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote
       products derived from this Original Work without express prior
       permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing
       in this License grants any license to Licensor's trademarks,
       copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property.
       No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
       made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the
       licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the
       trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original
       Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit
       Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any
       Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
    5. External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use,
       distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative
       Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may
       be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed
       or communicated to those persons or made available as an application
       intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the
       grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by
       You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under
       section 1(c).
    6. Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any
       Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark
       notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any
       notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an
       "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any
       Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution
       Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
       modified the Original Work.
    7. Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants
       that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights
       granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are
       sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission
       of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as
       expressly stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original
       Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT
       WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
       the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a
       particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
       WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential
       part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by
       this License except under this disclaimer.
    8. Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal
       theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
       otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect,
       special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising
       as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including,
       without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
       computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
       damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the
       extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
    9. Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to
       this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable
       acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You
       distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative
       Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
       obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License.
       This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed
       in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based
       upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and
       conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty.
       Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and
       limitations (including 'fair use' or 'fair dealing'). This License
       shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the
       rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the
       conditions in Section 1(c).
   10. Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate
       automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted
       to You by this License as of the date You commence an action,
       including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any
       licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This
       termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent
       infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software
       or hardware.
   11. Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to
       this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction
       wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary
       business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its
       conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations
       Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
       expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of
       this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
       requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the
       appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination
       of this License.
   12. Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
       seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be
       entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without
       limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in
       connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This
       section shall survive the termination of this License.
   13. Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be
       unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
       necessary to make it enforceable.
   14. Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License,
       whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity
       exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this
       License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls,
       is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of
       this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to
       cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract
       or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
       outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
   15. Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
       restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor
       promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
   16. Modification of This License. This License is Copyright (c) 2007 Zooko
       Wilcox-O'Hearn. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or
       communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License
       permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or
       to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License
       and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the
       "Modified License") and apply it to other original works of authorship
       subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any
       way that your Modified License is the "Transitive Grace Period Public
       Licence" or "TGPPL" and you may not use those names in the name of
       your Modified License; and (ii) You must replace the notice specified
       in the first paragraph above with the notice "Licensed under " or with
       a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in
       this License.

The file src/allmydata/util/statistics.py was originally licensed under the
GPL3, but on 2009-09-21 its author Shawn Willden declared: "I hereby license
all patches I have contributed or will contribute to the Allmydata Tahoe-LAFS
project, including the file 'statistics.py', under both the GNU General Public
License, version 2 or later, and under the Transitive Grace Period Public
License, version 1 or later."

The original author of file src/allmydata/util/mathutil.py , Zooko
Wilcox-O'Hearn, granted full rights to allmydata.com to re-license it as
they see fit, and they reclicensed it the same terms as Tahoe-LAFS
itself: you may use it under GPL version 2 or greater at your option or
under TGPPL version 1 or greater at your option.

The setuptools-0.6c16dev3.egg directory, which is not used in the debian package

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
		    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no

    2.2.2           2.2.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.3             2.2.2       2002-2003   PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.
